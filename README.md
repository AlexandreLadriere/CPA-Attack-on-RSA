# CPA Attack on RSA

Python implementation of an attack using CPA on a simplified RSA.

The subject of this lab is in the [TP-EMSE-2020.pdf] file (in french) and the [EMSE] folder contains several data sets used for the CPA. Since it is a baby RSA, the key can be retrieved by factorization. The [cpa_rsa.py] script calculates the key by factorization but also by CPA.
